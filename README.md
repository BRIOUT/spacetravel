Space Travel - React Spacecraft Management System
A full-featured React application for managing spacecraft and planetary evacuations. Built as a comprehensive educational project demonstrating production-level React patterns and best practices.

Overview
Space Travel is a React-based web application that simulates a spacecraft fleet management system. In a future where Earth has become uninhabitable, you manage spacecraft to evacuate humanity to newly terraformed planets across the solar system.
This project serves as a comprehensive React tutorial, with every line of code extensively documented and explained. It's perfect for:

Learning React from scratch
Understanding modern React patterns
Studying production-level code organization
Building portfolio projects

Project Goals

Demonstrate real-world React patterns (not toy examples)
Provide comprehensive code documentation (every line explained)
Implement full CRUD operations with proper state management
Showcase modern CSS techniques with CSS Modules
Create a professional, portfolio-worthy application
